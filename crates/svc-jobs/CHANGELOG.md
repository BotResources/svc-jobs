# Changelog — svc-jobs

All notable changes to this service are documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and
the service adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

The version in [`Cargo.toml`](Cargo.toml) is the source of truth. CI gates every
PR on `scripts/check-changelog.sh`: whatever version sits in `Cargo.toml` must
have a matching `## [${version}]` heading here. The `0.0.0-dev` placeholder this
crate ships with is the one exception — it maps to `## [Unreleased]`, which the
first real release promotes to a numbered heading.

## [Unreleased]

- Scaffolded by `runkit`: the composition root, the GraphQL edge with a single
  placeholder query, and the event-store migration. No behaviour yet.
- The service: migrations realising the sealed 0.1 database schema (including
  the bounded `run_logs` range partitions and the three read views), the
  PostgreSQL adapters behind the `bc-jobs` ports, the GraphQL edge serving the
  sealed SDL (five queries, three ack-only mutations, four snapshot-then-delta
  subscriptions over SSE), the integration bus through
  `br-util-nats-fabric` (four durable command consumers, transactional outbox
  for the eight published events), the confined runner transport (trigger
  publication and withdrawal, status and log consumption, the desired-state
  cancel bucket, the presence watch), and the dispatch and backstop loops.
- Every knob is configuration: `JOBS_INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`,
  `JOBS_RUN_MAX_DURATION_SECONDS`, `JOBS_RETRY_BASE_DELAY_SECONDS`,
  `JOBS_MAX_ATTEMPTS_CEILING`, `JOBS_BACKSTOP_INTERVAL_SECONDS`,
  `JOBS_DISPATCH_MINIMUM_WAKE_MILLISECONDS`, validated once at boot.
- A subscriber that falls irrecoverably behind the in-process fact stream ends
  its subscription instead of skipping the facts it missed: the client
  reconnects onto a fresh snapshot, and no list silently keeps a stale row.
- Watching a job watches its whole tree: every fact carried by a descendant, and
  every descendant joining the tree, pushes the delta that carries the refreshed
  projection.
- The whole user-facing surface is platform-administrator only: a missing or
  undecodable passport is answered `UNAUTHENTICATED`, any other caller
  `FORBIDDEN`, both as structured GraphQL errors, before a query, a mutation or
  a subscription establishment reaches a resolver.
- Declared NATS streams and buckets are bound, never created: an absent stream
  or bucket fails the boot loudly — readiness goes down, the failure is logged
  and the process stops with a non-zero code rather than lingering as a pod that
  will never be ready.
